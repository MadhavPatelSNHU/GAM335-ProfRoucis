- GAMEPLAY

	- UI for health bar is added
	- New UI for main menu and win/lose screens
	- Win Con are two trophies, one is different that makes you lose. The other is correct and sends you to the win screen (for the future: the next level). There now a coin/safe trophy that you can collect for points. When collected they will pop up in the debug log.
